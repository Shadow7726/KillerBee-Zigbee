- **Analyze MITM Traffic:** Understand communication patterns and sensitive data exchange.

## 7. Password Cracking
- **Crack Zigbee Network Key:** Attempt to crack the Zigbee network key.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** Crack weak or default passwords on Zigbee devices.

## 8. Post-Exploitation
- **Maintain Access:** If successful, maintain unauthorized access.
- **Pivot:** Explore lateral movement within the network.

## 9. Documentation and Reporting
- **Document Findings:** Record all vulnerabilities and exploitation details.
- **Prepare a Report:** Create a detailed report with recommendations.

## 10. Remediation
- **Recommend Mitigations:** Provide security recommendations and best practices.
- **Assist with Remediation:** Assist in implementing security measures and patches.
