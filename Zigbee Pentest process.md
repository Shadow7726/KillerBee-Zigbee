# Zigbee Attack Penetration Testing

## 1. Reconnaissance
- **Identify Target Networks:** Determine the Zigbee networks to test.
- **Network Discovery:** Utilize Zigbee network scanners for network discovery.

## 2. Mapping the Network
- **Identify Devices:** Enumerate Zigbee devices within the network.
- **Identify Gateways:** Recognize Zigbee coordinators/gateways.
- **Analyze Network Topology:** Understand the Zigbee network structure.

## 3. Vulnerability Scanning
- **Use Zigbee Vulnerability Scanners:** Employ specialized tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Fuzzing:** Conduct fuzzing attacks to identify weaknesses in Zigbee devices.

## 4. Zigbee Exploitation
- **Exploit Vulnerable Devices:** Attempt exploits on identified vulnerabilities.
- **Zigbee Exploitation Frameworks:** Utilize tools like the Attify Zigbee Framework for exploitation.

## 5. Sniffing and Analysis
- **Sniff Zigbee Traffic:** Capture and analyze Zigbee network traffic.
- **Decrypt Encrypted Traffic:** Decrypt encrypted Zigbee traffic for analysis.

## 6. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- **Perform MITM Attacks:** Intercept and manipulate Zigbee communications.
- **Analyze MITM Traffic:** Understand communication patterns and sensitive data exchange.

## 7. Password Cracking
- **Crack Zigbee Network Key:** Attempt to crack the Zigbee network key.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** Crack weak or default passwords on Zigbee devices.

## 8. Post-Exploitation
- **Maintain Access:** If successful, maintain unauthorized access.
- **Pivot:** Explore lateral movement within the network.

## 9. Documentation and Reporting
- **Document Findings:** Record all vulnerabilities and exploitation details.
- **Prepare a Report:** Create a detailed report with recommendations.

## 10. Remediation
- **Recommend Mitigations:** Provide security recommendations and best practices.
- **Assist with Remediation:** Assist in implementing security measures and patches.
